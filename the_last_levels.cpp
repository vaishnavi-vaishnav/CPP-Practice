// Chef is playing a videogame, and is getting close to the end. He decides to 
// finish the rest of the game in a single session.

// There are X levels remaining in the game, and each level takes Chef Y minutes 
// to complete. To protect against eye strain, Chef also decides that every time 
// he completes 3 levels, he will take a Z minute break from playing. Note that 
// there is no need to take this break if the game has been completed.

// How much time (in minutes) will it take Chef to complete the game?

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the 
// number of test cases.
// The first and only line of input will contain three space-separated integers 
// X, Y, and  Z. 

// Output Format:
// For each test case, output on a new line the answer â€” the length of 
// Chef's gaming session.
