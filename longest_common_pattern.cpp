// As we all know, Chef is cooking string for long days, his new discovery 
// on string is the longest common pattern length. The longest common pattern 
// length between two strings is the maximum number of characters that both 
// strings have in common. Characters are case sensitive, that is, lower case 
// and upper case characters are considered as different. Note that characters 
// can repeat in a string and a character might have one or more occurrence in 
// common between two strings. For example, if Chef has two strings 
// A = "Codechef" and B = "elfedcc", then the longest common pattern 
// length of A and B is 5 (common characters are c, d, e, e, f).

// Chef wants to test you with the problem described above. He will give 
// you two strings of Latin alphabets and digits, return him the longest 
// common pattern length.

// Input:
// The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number 
// of test cases. Then the description of T test cases follows.
// The first line of each test case contains a string A. The next line 
// contains another character string B.

// Output:
// For each test case, output a single line containing a single 
// integer, the longest common pattern length between A and B.
