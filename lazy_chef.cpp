// Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in 
// x units of time, he finishes it in mâˆ—x units of time. But there is always 
// a limit to laziness, 
// so he delays the work by at max d units of time. Given x,m,d, 
// find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

// Input Format:
// First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
// Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x,m,d.

// Output Format:
// For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.
